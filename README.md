# Dog & Cat Identifier

This tool will help you make a model, and run predictions

### Prerequisites

```sh
$ pip3 install requierments.txt
```
### How to run
- run the files in this order:
    1) DataSetup1.py: to setup the data necessary to build the model
    2) ModelCreatin2.py: to create the model
    3) SetupTesting3.py: to setup the data necessary to test the model
    4) RunTesting4.py: to test the model
- after doing these steps, a file with the name of "dogCatIden.model" will be created for you, and now you can run the file "predit.py" and append the path to your image to it, for example:
    - python3 predit.py test.jpg
    - python3 predit.py C:/Users/pc/Desktop/image.jpg
    etc..
